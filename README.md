# rick_and_morty_characters_explorer
- Build a Flutter application that displays character information

# Features
1. Data Retrieval & Display- Use the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation) to fetch a list of
   characters.- Display each character’s basic info (e.g., avatar image, name, species, status).
2. Search & Filtering- Provide a search bar to filter characters by name.- Implement additional filtering for:- Character status: Alive, Dead, unknown.- Species (e.g., Human, Alien, etc.).
3. Pagination- The API supports pagination. Implement pagination or “infinite scroll” to load more
   characters as the user scrolls.
4. Favorite Characters- Allow users to “favorite” characters.- Save these favorites locally using preferred database.- Provide a separate screen or tab to display only favorited characters.
5. State Management- Use a state management approach (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, MobX, or GetX).- Show how you manage data flow between API, UI, and local storage.
